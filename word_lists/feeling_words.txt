#Words Describing Feelings
#Here you will find part of the world's longest list of feeling words. (Also called emotion words or words that describe feelings.)
#The full list is now over 4,000 words. We also have over 600 words describing just the negative feelings. And we have a short list of Common Negative Feelings.
#The words in letters A-S are shown here. We will send the complete file via email for a donation of any size. (Ordering Details). We will also send a free copy of the list to anyone who donates new words. Please write if you want to contribute a new word.
#See also this article about "Talking away your pain." These words are best used when applied to the concept of emotional literacy.
